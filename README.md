**Giant warning!!**

Dash is under development. Many features are not complete, and the ones that are might change anytime in the future.

Once we have a language that works, a playground will be published to the [front page of our website](https://dashlang.org).
Dash is, and will be closed-source until the language is in a stable-enough state to be rewritten in itself.

Until then, feel free to [contact us](https://dashlang.org/contact) if you have any questions.

<h2></h2>

Dash is a brand new language designed to be the best of all worlds, combining elements from Go, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, and others.

Since it compiles down to raw C, it'll run anywhere and can take advantage of any C library easily.
